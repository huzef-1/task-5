# task-5
AWS-RDS-TASK 


---

I created an AWS RDS MySQL database named `my-db-task5` using the Free Tier and enabled public access. I chose manual authentication and set up a security group allowing SSH and MySQL access. After launching the RDS instance, I created a Linux EC2 instance and assigned it the same security group for connectivity. From the EC2 machine, I connected to the RDS database using the MySQL client with the RDS endpoint, username, and password. I verified the connection by running SQL commands to create tables, insert data, and query the database. Proper security group rules were ensured for connectivity, and public access was enabled cautiously due to security considerations. i got the  results then  deleted the database(my-bd-task5) & task5 instance as well.
